# Welcome to the SCHS Software Wiki

This wiki assumes that the reader has elementary knowledge of the FTC app and how the Robot Controller is used to connect to modules. The purpose of the wiki is to provide tips and instructions that are solutions to any tasks or issues one may face while programming a robot. The goal is that future software challenges will be overcome more efficiently, without the need for reinventing the wheel, because we already have quite a large inventory of metaphorical wheels (as well as physical ones).
